                <p class="text-muted">From a young age, I knew that I wanted to help children heal from the pain and fear that I felt so viscerally in their presence. My first step toward that dream led me to Lesley University (it was still Lesley College in 1997!) where I received my Bachelors of Science with a concentration on child and family development.¬† I favored Jung, with his theories of the collective unconscious, universal archetypes and personality traits, and sprinkled in a heavy dose of women‚Äôs studies and a particular interest in the emerging field of movement therapy. It was also my first introduction to Buddhist study and meditation.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">Nothing felt like the exact fit of how I wanted to help people but I continued on the traditional path and got my first job as a counselor at a residential treatment facility.  One day, my colleague invited me to a small party of her closest female friends.  It was a fun, comfortable evening full of laughter and great snacks, and when my friend walked over to her bookshelf all the ladies erupted in hoots and cheers as she pulled out a Tarot deck and an ancient-looking book.  She picked a card for the woman next to her, flipped through the book, and began to read.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">I‚Äôm not sure what emboldened me to speak up when I was surrounded by older women whom I‚Äôd just met, but before I knew it, I was adding specific details to the vague book passage. My friend‚Äôs mouth hung open and she quickly turned to the woman next to her and swore that she had never talked to me about her personal life. I nodded emphatically that it was true. But then my friend turned to me and questioned how I could possibly know the things I did. I shrugged, suddenly self-conscious, and gave my honest answer‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know, it was just something that I‚Äôd always been able to sense about some people, and didn‚Äôt know that it wasn‚Äôt the norm.  The rest of the women begged me to pull a card for them and give my impressions. A few years later I decided to get some formal training in Tarot at Regina Russell‚Äôs Tea Room.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">Did I mention that I got my MFA in creative writing?! I‚Äôll stop the stories now and just bullet out a brief snapshot of my most influential study that informs my current work. You can always ask questions about my background if you have them and I will answer as best I can.</p>
